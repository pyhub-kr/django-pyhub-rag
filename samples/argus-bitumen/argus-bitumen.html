<p id='6' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:20px'>SUMMARY</p>

<p id='7' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Bitumen prices rose across much of Europe, as supply<br>tightened in the north and fuel oil values firmed, while in<br>Asia weak demand continued to weigh on the market, with<br>Singapore and South Korean prices both down on the week.</p>

<br><p id='8' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Disruptions at two French refineries continued to<br>squeeze bitumen supply in northwest Europe, helping to<br>push up Rotterdam and Baltic cargo differentials to fob Rot-<br>terdam high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) barges.</p>

<br><p id='9' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Mediterranean bitumen market activity and demand lev-<br>els were starting to rise with warmer weather in many Euro-<br>pean markets, a factor that along with rising regional HSFO<br>prices, pushed up domestic truck prices in some markets.</p>

<br><p id='10' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Price levels in most sub-Saharan African markets were<br>broadly stable, although cargo values into west African ter-<br>minals rose sharply, while there were some freight rate falls<br>for container shipping movements into east Africa.</p>

<br><p id='11' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Singapore bitumen prices edged lower, as the southeast<br>Asian market continued to see a lack of demand outlets,<br>with only limited buyers seeking out April-loading cargoes.<br>Several oil majors were still holding on to unsold April-load-<br>ing volumes and some emerged on the Argus Open Markets<br>(AOM) platform to seek out buyers.</p>

<br><p id='39' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Disruption at two French refineries continued to squeeze<br>overall bitumen supply in northwest Europe (see news),<br>pushing up Rotterdam and Baltic cargo differentials to fob<br>Rotterdam high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) barges.</p>

<br><p id='40' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>The halt to bitumen truck loadings at ExxonMobil's Port<br>Jerome refinery in northern France mid-March ratcheted<br>up regional supply restrictions, given the existing issues at<br>TotalEnergies' Donges refinery on the French Atlantic coast.</p>

<br><p id='41' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>ExxonMobil is also understood to have declared force<br>majeure on at least two bitumen cargoes that were due<br>to be loaded at Port Jerome in the late-March/early-April<br>period, although the firm did manage to load one cargo<br>onto the 6,165 dwt An Hai Wan, with that shipment head-<br>ing to Antwerp, potentially to feed ExxonMobil's coker at its<br>refinery there that has no bitumen production units, market<br>participants said.</p>

<br><p id='42' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>While the Donges refinery as a whole is not expected<br>to restart before early-April, some bitumen production has<br>gradually resumed, allowing a cargo to be loaded there<br>on the 6,189 dwt Iver Blessing for shipments towards the<br>Nordics.</p>

<br><p id='43' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>While Shell's Pernis refinery turnaround through to mid-<br>April was still not seen impacting bitumen production units<br>there, the firm's significant commitment to term deals into<br>Nordic buyers meant spot cargo availability remained scarce,<br>forcing up assessed Rotterdam and Baltic fob cargo differen-<br>tials to fob Rotterdam HSFO barges $7-8/t higher to $15-20/t<br>and around $5/t premiums respectively.</p>

<p id='118' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:22px'>Summary</p>

<br><p id='119' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Mediterranean bitumen market activity and demand levels<br>were starting to rise with warmer weather in many European<br>markets, a factor that along with rising regional high-sulphur<br>fuel oil (HSFO) prices, pushed up domestic truck prices in<br>some markets.</p>

<br><p id='120' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Italian domestic truck prices were assessed €10/t higher<br>at €505-515/t ex-works, including the €31/t tax on the<br>sale of bitumen, while those in Greece rose by €20-25/t to<br>€485-490/t ex-works and Turkish refiner Tupras raised its<br>posted domestic truck prices by Turkish Lira 730/t ($19/t) to<br>TL16,651/t ($516/t).</p>

<br><p id='121' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Spot demand for both cargoes and bitumen tankers was<br>still fairly weak, keeping freight rates under pressure.</p>

<br><p id='122' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Differentials to HSFO remained steady and this was in<br>part linked to hefty new Mediterranean HSFO price gains<br>that also dramatically narrowed the fob Rotterdam HSFO<br>barge premium to fob Mediterranean cargoes to around $1/t<br>from $11-12/t in the previous week. That made it difficult<br>to justify spot cargo flows from south to north to help meet<br>supply shortfalls into northwest European and Scandinavian<br>markets caused by French refinery stoppages.</p>

<br><p id='123' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Spanish fob cargo discounts to fob Mediterranean HSFO<br>cargoes stayed assessed at $5-10/t, with Greek, Turkish and<br>Italian exports all remaining in the same assessed range<br>around $10/t fob discounts. With fob Rotterdam and Baltic<br>cargo differentials to fob Rotterdam HSFO barges strength-<br>ening, that at least gave some encouragement to potential<br>arbitrage flows from the Mediterranean to northern Europe.</p>

<br><p id='124' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>But Mediterranean supply continues to far outstrip<br>bitumen requirements within the region, with some tanker<br>movements made to the US and west Africa, as well as<br>northwest Europe.</p>

<br><p id='142' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Disruptions at two French refineries have squeezed bitumen<br>supply in northwest Europe just as the region's spring road<br>paving season gets underway.</p>

<br><p id='143' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>ExxonMobil halted bitumen truck loadings from its<br>236,000 b/d Port Jerome refinery in northern France last<br>week after a fire hit a crude distillation unit on 11 March,<br>compounding problems at TotalEnergies' 219,300 b/d Donges<br>refinery.</p>

<br><p id='144' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:14px'>In a letter sent to Port Jerome customers, ExxonMobil<br>said it could not "confirm with certainty the date on which<br>bitumen deliveries will become fully operational again and<br>cannot advance any date on which sales of our products<br>could resume normally".</p>

<br><p id='145' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:14px'>The company is also understood to have declared force<br>majeure on two bitumen cargoes that were due to be loaded<br>from Port Jerome in the next few weeks, although it did<br>manage to load one cargo onto the 6,165 dwt An Hai Wan,<br>according to a market participant. That cargo was due to<br>arrive at Antwerp 20 March.</p>

<br><p id='146' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>The disruption at Port Jerome coincides with an ongo-<br>ing shutdown at the Donges refinery linked to inspections<br>by local authorities. Although TotalEnergies said it does not<br>expect a full restart until the start of April, bitumen produc-<br>tion appears to have resumed already, with tracking data<br>from Kpler and Vortexa showing the 6,189dwt Iver Blessing<br>loading a bitumen cargo from Donges on 20 March.</p>

<br><p id='147' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Bitumen availability at TotalEnergies' 246,000 b/d Gon-<br>freville refinery in northern France's Normandy region is also<br>constrained. Some buyers say the refinery has yet to resume<br>spot sales following the end of maintenance last week.</p>

<br><p id='148' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>The squeeze on French bitumen has led to a sharp<br>increase in demand for alternative supply from elsewhere in<br>northwest Europe, which has pushed up Rotterdam and Bal-<br>tic fob cargo premiums to high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) barges<br>in recent weeks.</p>

<br><p id='149' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Shell's 404,000 b/d Pernis plant, Europe's biggest re-<br>finery, is undergoing a rolling turnaround until mid-April.<br>Although most regional market players say the work has<br>had a minimal impact on Pernis' bitumen supplies, Shell's<br>significant commitment to term deals with Nordic buyers<br>has restricted surpluses available for the spot market. Some<br>inland buyers in northwest Europe have reported limited<br>availability of truck supplies from Pernis.</p>

<br><p id='150' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>The French refinery outages have also increased demand<br>for Mediterranean bitumen imports to northwest Europe.<br>A large bitumen cargo that was loaded at Greece's Agioi<br>Theodoroi export terminal arrived at trading firm Vitol's</p>

<br><p id='151' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Antwerp terminal last week on board the company's 36,771<br>dwt Asphalt Synergy. It was a timely delivery and the first of<br>its kind this year.</p>

<br><p id='152' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>Bitumen cargoes are regularly moved from the Mediter-<br>ranean to northern Europe as part of term supply deals. But<br>even though the Mediterranean currently holds sizeable bitu-<br>men surpluses, the price gap between northwest European<br>and Mediterranean bitumen prices is still too narrow to trig-<br>ger significant south to north spot cargo flows.</p>

<br><p id='153' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>This is partly because tight fuel oil supply and strong<br>Mediterranean bunker demand have triggered a fresh spike<br>in fob Mediterranean HSFO cargo prices, which reached a<br>discount of just $0.75/t to fob Rotterdam HSFO barge values<br>on 19 March, compared with a $17.25/t discount on 11 March<br>and a $27/t discount on 19 January. Mediterranean and<br>northwest European bitumen cargoes are mainly traded as<br>differentials to HSFO prices in the respective regions.</p>

<p id='164' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>the AIA said local authorities in England and Wales had in<br>their financial year ending 31 March "experienced a real-<br>term [spending] cut due to the impact of rising costs due<br>to inflation". That was "despite average [road] maintenance<br>budgets increasing by 2.3pc to £26.4mm per authority", the<br>AIA said, finding that 45pc of local authorities reported a cut<br>or freeze in their highway maintenance budgets even before<br>inflation was taken into account.</p>

<br><p id='165' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>The steady deterioration of the road network contrib-<br>uted to a 43pc annual increase in the number of potholes<br>reported by local authorities to have been filled in England<br>and Wales during 2023-24, to an eight-year high of 2mn.</p>

<br><p id='166' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>UK bitumen consumption fell in 2023 to 1.54mn t, the<br>lowest since 2016, according to provisional government data<br>released earlier this month.</p>

<br><p id='167' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>In its survey conclusions, the AIA also said today the<br>"one-time catch-up cost" of bringing roads in England and<br>Wales up to the standard enabling the network to be man-<br>aged cost-effectively had jumped by 16pc to a new record<br>high of £16.3bn, and that the work needed to address the<br>shortfall would take a decade to complete. It said the ad-<br>ditional funds English and Welsh local authorities would have<br>needed to maintain their networks in accordance with their<br>own targets is £1.22bn, meaning the average shortfall in<br>their 2023-24 carriageway budget was £7.2mm per authority.</p>

<p id='191' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>The closure of Donges has prompted a number of short<br>haul oil products cargoes to be imported at the refinery<br>terminal in March. Two crude cargoes are signalling arrival<br>at the port around the turn of the month, suggestive of a<br>restart. A shipment of about 130,000t of Angolan Clov and<br>90,000t of US WTI are slated to arrive on 29 March and 3<br>April, respectively.</p>

<br><p id='193' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Finland's Neste said production will not be affected by a<br>strike underway at its 205,000 b/d Porvoo oil refinery, but<br>port and terminal operations will be disrupted.</p>

<br><p id='194' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>The Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK)<br>announced a two-week strike, between 11-25 March, in re-<br>sponse to government plans to changes in labour laws, right<br>to strike and social welfare.</p>

<br><p id='195' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>"Neste and the industrial union agreed that essential<br>work will continue during the announced strikes," the<br>company said. "This essential work enables safe operations<br>at Neste's Porvoo refinery and the continuation of critical<br>product deliveries, safeguarding the national security of<br>supply. Despite these agreed actions the strike will cause<br>disruptions to the distribution of fuels."</p>

<br><p id='196' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:16px'>An importer to Finnish bitumen terminals said the<br>schedule for bitumen cargo movements in and out of the<br>country has already been affected, just as this year's Nordic<br>road paving and bitumen-consuming season starts to get into<br>gear.</p>

<br><p id='197' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>The importer said it had been able to re-arrange vessels<br>to arrive after the end of the strike period, but said there<br>are concerns about potential further action beyond those<br>already planned by unions.</p>

<br><p id='198' data-category='paragraph' style='font-size:18px'>Neste plans a nine-week refinery-wide maintenance<br>between April-June at Porvoo. The plant has a 250,000 t/<br>yr Group III base oil unit that accounts for around 28pc of<br>Europe's Group III nameplate capacity.</p>
