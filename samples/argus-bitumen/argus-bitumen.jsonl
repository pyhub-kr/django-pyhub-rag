bitumen supply in northwest Europe (see news),\npushing up Rotterdam and Baltic cargo differentials to fob\nRotterdam high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) barges.\n\nThe halt to bitumen truck loadings at ExxonMobil's Port\nJerome refinery in northern France mid-March ratcheted\nup regional supply restrictions, given the existing issues at\nTotalEnergies' Donges refinery on the French Atlantic coast.\n\nExxonMobil is also understood to have declared force\nmajeure on at least two bitumen cargoes that were due\nto be loaded at Port Jerome in the late-March/early-April\nperiod, although the firm did manage to load one cargo\nonto the 6,165 dwt An Hai Wan, with that shipment head-\ning to Antwerp, potentially to feed ExxonMobil's coker at its\nrefinery there that has no bitumen production units, market\nparticipants said.\n\nWhile the Donges refinery as a whole is not expected\nto restart before early-April, some bitumen production has\ngradually resumed, allowing a cargo to be loaded there\non the 6,189 dwt Iver Blessing for shipments towards the\nNordics.\n\nWhile Shell's Pernis refinery turnaround through to mid-\nApril was still not seen impacting bitumen production units\nthere, the firm's significant commitment to term deals into\nNordic buyers meant spot cargo availability remained scarce,\nforcing up assessed Rotterdam and Baltic fob cargo differen-\ntials to fob Rotterdam HSFO barges $7-8/t higher to $15-20/t\nand around $5/t premiums respectively.\n\nThe regional supply restrictions also pushed up spot\nprices for some inland sales, with domestic truck prices in\nFrance and Benelux markets assessed slightly firmer.\n\nRecent drone strikes on Russian refineries were badly\n\nRotterdam V Baltic V Med (outright waterborne)

That made it difficult\nto justify spot cargo flows from south to north to help meet\nsupply shortfalls into northwest European and Scandinavian\nmarkets caused by French refinery stoppages.\n\nSpanish fob cargo discounts to fob Mediterranean HSFO\ncargoes stayed assessed at $5-10/t, with Greek, Turkish and\nItalian exports all remaining in the same assessed range\naround $10/t fob discounts.

Some\noffers to south China were at $430-460/t cfr and higher, but\nthese attracted muted buying interest. Buying indications\nwere as low as $360/t fob Singapore, though these remain\ncompletely unworkable for Singapore exporters.\n\nCompetitive domestic prices in Malaysia also kept inter-\nest for truck cargoes at bay. Prices for Singapore tank trucks\nsold into Malaysia fell again to $403-416/t ex-refinery from\n$415-424/t ex-refinery last week, in line with higher supplies\nrelative to demand.\n\n# Malaysia\n\nSingapore refiners continued to redirect supplies towards\ntrucked bitumen exports to Malaysia. They also consecutive-\nly lowered offer prices again to remain competitive against\neach other. The export quotas of trucked bitumen were\nstable at around 6-7 truckloads per buyer daily.\n\nLifting of bitumen material was mixed, with some Sin-\ngapore refiners experiencing slower lifting compared with\ndomestic sellers. This is likely because of location advantag-\nes that domestic sellers have, on top of competitive pricing\nagainst Singapore offers.\n\nEx-Malacca listed prices fell further to 1,860-2,050\nringgit/t ($392.59-432.57/t) from 2,070-2,120 ringgit/t last\nweek.

This was against offers for April-loadings at $450-460/t\ncfr levels.\n\nImport interest from south China remained lacklustre, as\nthe region continues to grapple with slow consumption and\nhigher inventory levels. Offers were around $440-450/t cfr\nsouth China, but this attracted little buying interest.\n\nSome April-loading exports from south China were sold at\nprices well above $400/t fob, higher than current Singapore\nexport prices.\n\n# Taiwan\n\nTaiwan export prices were pressured lower, tracking losses\nin the wider Asia-Pacific region. Some offers and selling in-\ndications were at around $405/t fob Taiwan, but these were\nmet with no buying interest from southeast Asian importers.\nBuying indications from the key consuming southeast Asian\n\nBandar Abbas: drums and bulk\n\n![image](p015/93-chart.jpg)\n- Chart Type: line\n|  | 7 Jul | 29 Sep | 22 Dec | 22 Mar |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| item_01 | 280arums | 410arums | 350arums | 280arums |\n\n\n$/t\n\nmarkets were at around $390/t fob, as the lack of available\nullage curbed demand for imports.\n\nAustralia & New Zealand\n\nDomestic consumption is gradually waning ahead of Easter\nholidays. Participants said demand could fall significantly\nthereafter and the slow market momentum may last through\nApril before picking up again in May-June, albeit not signifi-\ncantly, when contractors start wrapping up roadwork proj-\nects ahead of the end of the current financial year in June.\n\nIndia\n\nConsumption in some parts of country picked up as many\ncontractors were trying to wrap up projects ahead of the\nend of the current financial year ending this month. But\nimporters and dealers noted that demand was still below\nnormal because of a funding crunch, which induced a slow-\ndown in state-government linked works.\n\nDemand for imported cargoes at Mangalore and Karwar\nport were robust, and this increased enquiries for seaborne\ncargoes for discharge into these ports. But demand was rela-\ntively lacklustre at Mumbai and some ports of Gujarat.\n\nAt least 9,000-10,000t of forward loading bulk bitumen\nwas purchased at $280-290/t on fob basis. This was lower\nthan the 33,000-38,000t transacted last week as most of the\nsuppliers in the Middle East took to the sidelines to cel-\nebrate a regional new year, limiting market activity.\n\nAlthough bids and indications were below $280/t on\nfob basis, limited prompt laycan supply kept the discus-\nsion and transaction range at $280-290/t fob, little changed\nfrom last week's $283-290/t fob. Importers also mentioned\nthat despite improvement in domestic sales, profit margins\ncontinued to be squeezed also because of the additional\ndemurrage incurred on the back of the port congestions\nin the Middle East. Meanwhile, market participants expect\nconsumption to falter next week because of holidays linked\nto the Hindu Holi festival.\n\nState-controlled refiners in Mumbai reduced listed VG10\nand VG30 bulk and drummed bitumen prices by 570 rupees/t\n($6.85/t) for the current fortnight, from the previous two-\nweek period.

That cargo was due to\narrive at Antwerp 20 March.\n\nThe disruption at Port Jerome coincides with an ongo-\ning shutdown at the Donges refinery linked to inspections\nby local authorities. Although TotalEnergies said it does not\nexpect a full restart until the start of April, bitumen produc-\ntion appears to have resumed already, with tracking data\nfrom Kpler and Vortexa showing the 6,189dwt Iver Blessing\nloading a bitumen cargo from Donges on 20 March.\n\nBitumen availability at TotalEnergies' 246,000 b/d Gon-\nfreville refinery in northern France's Normandy region is also\nconstrained. Some buyers say the refinery has yet to resume\nspot sales following the end of maintenance last week.\n\nThe squeeze on French bitumen has led to a sharp\nincrease in demand for alternative supply from elsewhere in\nnorthwest Europe, which has pushed up Rotterdam and Bal-\ntic fob cargo premiums to high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) barges\nin recent weeks.\n\nShell's 404,000 b/d Pernis plant, Europe's biggest re-\nfinery, is undergoing a rolling turnaround until mid-April.\nAlthough most regional market players say the work has\nhad a minimal impact on Pernis' bitumen supplies, Shell's\nsignificant commitment to term deals with Nordic buyers\nhas restricted surpluses available for the spot market. Some\ninland buyers in northwest Europe have reported limited\navailability of truck supplies from Pernis.\n\nThe French refinery outages have also increased demand\nfor Mediterranean bitumen imports to northwest Europe.\nA large bitumen cargo that was loaded at Greece's Agioi\nTheodoroi export terminal arrived at trading firm Vitol's\n\nAntwerp terminal last week on board the company's 36,771\ndwt Asphalt Synergy. It was a timely delivery and the first of\nits kind this year.\n\nBitumen cargoes are regularly moved from the Mediter-\nranean to northern Europe as part of term supply deals. But\neven though the Mediterranean currently holds sizeable bitu-\nmen surpluses, the price gap between northwest European\nand Mediterranean bitumen prices is still too narrow to trig-\nger significant south to north spot cargo flows.\n\nThis is partly because tight fuel oil supply and strong\nMediterranean bunker demand have triggered a fresh spike\nin fob Mediterranean HSFO cargo prices, which reached a\ndiscount of just $0.75/t to fob Rotterdam HSFO barge values\non 19 March, compared with a $17.25/t discount on 11 March\nand a $27/t discount on 19 January.

{"page_content": "Argus Bitumen\n\nIssue 24-12  Friday 22 March 2024\n\n# NEWS\n\nThe closure of Donges has prompted a number of short\nhaul oil products cargoes to be imported at the refinery\nterminal in March. Two crude cargoes are signalling arrival\nat the port around the turn of the month, suggestive of a\nrestart. A shipment of about 130,000t of Angolan Clov and\n90,000t of US WTI are slated to arrive on 29 March and 3\nApril, respectively.\n\nNeste says Porvoo strike will not affect output\n\nFinland's Neste said production will not be affected by a\nstrike underway at its 205,000 b/d Porvoo oil refinery, but\nport and terminal operations will be disrupted.\n\nThe Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK)\nannounced a two-week strike, between 11-25 March, in re-\nsponse to government plans to changes in labour laws, right\nto strike and social welfare.\n\n\"Neste and the industrial union agreed that essential\nwork will continue during the announced strikes,\" the\ncompany said. \"This essential work enables safe operations\nat Neste's Porvoo refinery and the continuation of critical\nproduct deliveries, safeguarding the national security of\nsupply. Despite these agreed actions the strike will cause\ndisruptions to the distribution of fuels.\"\n\nAn importer to Finnish bitumen terminals said the\nschedule for bitumen cargo movements in and out of the\ncountry has already been affected, just as this year's Nordic\nroad paving and bitumen-consuming season starts to get into\ngear.\n\nThe importer said it had been able to re-arrange vessels\nto arrive after the end of the strike period, but said there\nare concerns about potential further action beyond those\nalready planned by unions.\n\nNeste plans a nine-week refinery-wide maintenance\nbetween April-June at Porvoo. The plant has a 250,000 t/\nyr Group III base oil unit that accounts for around 28pc of\nEurope's Group III nameplate capacity.\n\nNeste will convert Porvoo into a 3mn t/yr renewables\nfacility, and withdraw from crude refining. It will produce\nseveral renewable and circular products instead including,\nbiodiesel, sustainable aviation fluid, polymers and chemicals\nas feedstocks.\n\nColombian Ecopetrol's sales rise in 2023\n\nColombian state-controlled oil company Ecopetrol's asphalt/\nbitumen sales increased in 2023, boosted by rising exports\nand domestic demand for several advanced road projects.\n\nEcopetrol's sold 698,225 metric tonnes (t) of asphalt to\nthe domestic and international markets last year, a 4pc rise\nfrom 2022.\n\nThe increase helped the firm reduce scope 3 emissions,\nreplace production of fuel oil and strengthen its position in\nthe international market, it said.\n\nEcopetrol sold a little more than 50pc of its asphalt\nproduction in the international market last year, former\nproduct and petrochemicals manager Felipe Trujillo had said\npreviously.\n\nBut the firm did not specify how much of the total sales\nwere exported, saying that such information is confidential.\nEcopetrol exported almost 270,560t of asphalt in January-\nOctober, up from approximately 254,900t shipped in all of\n2022, according to Trujillo.\n\nEcopetrol exported around 342,170t of asphalt in 2023,\naccording to data by trade analytics firm Kpler. That is a\nnear 40pc hike from 2022.\n\nThe main export destinations were the US, Puerto Rico,\nChile, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Mexico and Honduras,\nEcopetrol said. Latin American asphalt buyers shifted to buy-\ning more regionally in 2023, a source said.\n\nEcopetrol began exporting asphalt to Chile for the first\ntime in July, when it shipped 12,000t to the country.\n\nIn the domestic market, Colombia moved forward with\nseveral road projects, according to infrastructure agency\nANI. It inaugurated a stretch of a double-lane corridor that\nconnects Bogota with towns in the capital's outskirts in Au-\ngust. The project is part of larger plan that comprises 66km\n(41 miles) in double-lane corridors demanding Ps1.87 trillion\nColombian pesos ($477mn) in investments.\n\nSpanish construction firm Sacyr started working on a\nstretch of the Pamplona-Cucuta road in May. Colombia also\ninaugurated a 49km stretch of the Autopista al Rio Magda-\nlena 2 road, which comprises 153km, in July.\n\nColombia's $20bn 4G infrastructure plan comprises 29\npublicly and privately funded highway projects.\n\nLast year the country also paved a section of a Bogota El\nDorado Airport taxiway with modified asphalt that contains\n415kg of recycled plastic.", "metadata": {"id": 188, "page": 30, "total_pages": 21, "category": "header", "api": "2.0", "model": "document-parse-250116", "source": "argus-bitumen.pdf"}}
