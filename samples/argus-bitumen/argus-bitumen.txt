SUMMARY

Bitumen prices rose across much of Europe, as supply
tightened in the north and fuel oil values firmed, while in
Asia weak demand continued to weigh on the market, with
Singapore and South Korean prices both down on the week.

Disruptions at two French refineries continued to
squeeze bitumen supply in northwest Europe, helping to
push up Rotterdam and Baltic cargo differentials to fob Rot-
terdam high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) barges.

Mediterranean bitumen market activity and demand lev-
els were starting to rise with warmer weather in many Euro-
pean markets, a factor that along with rising regional HSFO
prices, pushed up domestic truck prices in some markets.

Price levels in most sub-Saharan African markets were
broadly stable, although cargo values into west African ter-
minals rose sharply, while there were some freight rate falls
for container shipping movements into east Africa.

Singapore bitumen prices edged lower, as the southeast
Asian market continued to see a lack of demand outlets,
with only limited buyers seeking out April-loading cargoes.
Several oil majors were still holding on to unsold April-load-
ing volumes and some emerged on the Argus Open Markets
(AOM) platform to seek out buyers.

NORTH AND CENTRAL EUROPE MARKET COMMENTARY

Summary

Disruption at two French refineries continued to squeeze
overall bitumen supply in northwest Europe (see news),
pushing up Rotterdam and Baltic cargo differentials to fob
Rotterdam high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) barges.

The halt to bitumen truck loadings at ExxonMobil's Port
Jerome refinery in northern France mid-March ratcheted
up regional supply restrictions, given the existing issues at
TotalEnergies' Donges refinery on the French Atlantic coast.

ExxonMobil is also understood to have declared force
majeure on at least two bitumen cargoes that were due
to be loaded at Port Jerome in the late-March/early-April
period, although the firm did manage to load one cargo
onto the 6,165 dwt An Hai Wan, with that shipment head-
ing to Antwerp, potentially to feed ExxonMobil's coker at its
refinery there that has no bitumen production units, market
participants said.

While the Donges refinery as a whole is not expected
to restart before early-April, some bitumen production has
gradually resumed, allowing a cargo to be loaded there
on the 6,189 dwt Iver Blessing for shipments towards the
Nordics.

While Shell's Pernis refinery turnaround through to mid-
April was still not seen impacting bitumen production units
there, the firm's significant commitment to term deals into
Nordic buyers meant spot cargo availability remained scarce,
forcing up assessed Rotterdam and Baltic fob cargo differen-
tials to fob Rotterdam HSFO barges $7-8/t higher to $15-20/t
and around $5/t premiums respectively.

The regional supply restrictions also pushed up spot
prices for some inland sales, with domestic truck prices in
France and Benelux markets assessed slightly firmer.

Recent drone strikes on Russian refineries were badly

NORTH AND CENTRAL EUROPE MARKET COMMENTARY

affecting some such facilities, especially Lukoil's Volgograd
refinery, which have impacted domestic supply.

UK/Ireland

Real-term cuts in local authority road maintenance budgets
in England and Wales have caused a further deterioration in
their road surfaces, UK asphalt industry body AIA said on 19
March (see news).

The steady deterioration of the road network contrib-
uted to a 43pc annual increase in the number of potholes
reported by local authorities to have been filled in England
and Wales during 2023-24, to an eight-year high of 2mn. In
its survey conclusions, the AIA also said the "one-time catch-
up cost" of bringing roads in England and Wales up to the
standard enabling the network to be managed cost-effective-
ly had jumped by 16pc to a new record high of £16.3bn.

Market participants said bitumen demand was starting to
improve in the UK and Ireland as the weather has continued
to get warmer, with second half March UK activity sharply up
from the first half of the month.

UK delivered truck assessed at £465-475/t.

prices stayed
Two cargoes arrived at terminals on the Thames aboard
the 6,314 dwt Bithav and 4,995 dwt San Bacco that were
loaded at Rotterdam and Brunsbuettel respectively.

France

Warm and dry weather supported paving activity across
France, while refinery disruptions limited supply, pushing
delivered truck assessments in northern and central France
€2-3/t higher to €510-525/t.

Delivered truck prices in southern France stayed assessed
at €480-490/t as there remains plentiful Mediterranean bitu-
men supply.

The fire at the Port Jerome refinery and the subsequent
halt to truck loadings of most grades of bitumen led one
buyer to re-route term deal supplies from the south of the
country to the north in order to avoid purchasing bitumen
trucks on a spot basis.

Bitumen availability at TotalEnergies' Gonfreville refinery
was also constrained, buyers said, indicating the refinery
has yet to resume spot sales following the end of bitumen-
focused planned maintenance there in mid-March.

According to CPDP data, French bitumen consumption
in the first two months of the year was 135,000t, down 9pc
from the same period of 2023, market participants said.

Benelux

Domestic truck prices across the Benelux region were as-
sessed €5/t higher at €530-540/t ex-Antwerp and ex-Rotter-
dam as intra-month spot values rose with buyers looking to
making up for supply shortfalls caused by issues at French
refineries.

Enquiries for Benelux bitumen supplies into the French
market continued to be strong for the same reason.

The 36,771dwt Asphalt Synergy was set to load a second
large cargo at Agioi Theodoroi, Greece, for likely shipment
to Antwerp, having delivered its first cargo of the year into
Vitol's Antwerp terminal. The tanker left Antwerp in 18
March and was set to reach Gibraltar on 23 March on its way
to Greece. Those flows have been helping to fill north Euro-
pean supply shortfalls, including in Benelux markets.

Germany

No week-on-week truck price changes emerged in Germany
or for its exports to Poland.

Market participants said two out of three of Miro's
shareholders did not have volumes of pen 70/100 available
for loading at its Karlsruhe refinery, while truck queues were
seen outside Shell's Godorf refinery after a technical issue
briefly paused bitumen output there.

Bayernoil's Neustadt-Vohburg refinery remained in main-
tenance, with bitumen volumes set to resume in early April.
One market participant said a German buyer was seeking
a Baltic-loaded bitumen cargo for delivery into a location
near the Kiel Canal.

Czech Republic/Poland/Slovakia/Ukraine

Czech truck export prices to Germany were assessed €45/t
lower at €405-415/t ex-works as Orlen sought to sell stored
bitumen volumes ahead of its planned Litvinov refinery turn-
around in April, market participants said.

Argus Bitumen

NORTH AND CENTRAL EUROPE MARKET COMMENTARY

Czech domestic truck prices were assessed €10/t lower
at €435-450/t ex-works, while Polish domestic truck prices
stayed assessed at €500-510/t ex-works. Polish farmers set
up roadblocks across most of the country on 20 March, mak-
ing deliveries of bitumen difficult.

The first round of Slovakian presidential elections were
set for 23 March, with some seeing the electoral process
boosting activity and bitumen demand.

Ukrainian bitumen demand continued to be lacklustre
due to lack of governmental funding and poor weather
conditions. Ukrainian bitumen imports in the first 17 days of
March amounted to 1,220t, mostly from Lithuania.

Orlen increased its export prices to Ukraine from its
Plock refinery by €10/t to €460-465/t ex-works for pen 50/70
and 70/100. Independent Polish trading company Uni-Bitu-
men moved up its values for the Ukrainian market by €18/t
to €521/t ex-Jaslo.

Domestic Ukrainian truck prices for Polish and Lithuanian
bitumen in the western regions of Ukraine increased by 700-
800 hryvnia/t to 26 000-26 500 hryvnia/t (€612-624/t) fca
given the increase in import values coupled with the recent
devaluation of the Ukrainian currency.

Prices for domestically produced bitumen in the central
regions of Ukraine were flat on the week at 27,000-27,300
hryvnia/t (€636-643/t) ex-works.

Romania/Hungary/Balkans/Austria

Bitumen production restarted at Rompetrol's Vega refinery
in Ploiesti, Romania, on 18 March, while market participants
were told bitumen output would resume at the Burgas refin-
ery in Bulgaria on 25 March.

Bulgaria has been importing cargoes of Iraqi Basrah as
well as Libyan and Egyptian crude grades after it halted
imports of Russian Urals due to EU sanctions.

The Rompetrol restart, as well as cargo imports into
Romanian Black Sea ports, were seen helping to build stocks
ahead of strong anticipated activity and demand in Romania
where multiple elections are to be be held this year. Rainy
and cold weather for the time being restricted work in parts
of the country, although southern Romania was busy with
paving work.

Romanian domestic truck prices were assessed €55/t
higher at €545-555/t ex-works as Rompetrol issued its first
prices for this season, while Hungarian domestic truck prices
stayed assessed at €525-535/t ex-works. Hungarian exports
to Romania were assessed €5/t higher at €525-535/t ex-
works. Polish exports to Romania were assessed €5/t firmer
at €465-475/t ex-works.

There remained no Serbian or Austrian export flows to
Romania, keeping those assessments unchanged.

with an Agioi Theodoroi, Greece cargo, while the 6,065 dwt
Fuji Lava, loaded at Taranto, Italy was set to arrive at Galati

Nordics/Baltics

Suppliers pointed to a sharp rise in project activity in the
Baltic states, drawing substantial truck volumes from Orlen
Lietuva's Mazeikiai refinery in Lithuania, as well as regional
storage terminals.

Truck prices from the Mazeikiai refinery stayed at €500/t
ex-works for customers in the Baltic states, while lower
prices were offered to importers in Ukraine.

The 11-25 March strike by the Central Organisation of
Finnish Trade Unions (SAK), affecting Finnish ports, forced
a Finnish bitumen importer to reschedule bitumen cargo
deliveries at the country gears up for the impending start of
its paving season (see news).

The importer said it had been able to re-arrange vessels
to arrive after the end of the strike period, but said there
are concerns about potential further strike action.

The 8,297 dwt Stella Polaris, loaded at Delfzijl, went
on to deliver a part cargo into Norrkoping, Sweden after
an initial delivery into Kolding, Denmark. The 4,972 dwt

Sweden. The 4,900 dwt Bitfjord moved a Rotterdam cargo to
Stavanger, Norway, arriving there on 20 March.

MEDITERRANEAN MARKET COMMENTARY

Summary

Mediterranean bitumen market activity and demand levels
were starting to rise with warmer weather in many European
markets, a factor that along with rising regional high-sulphur
fuel oil (HSFO) prices, pushed up domestic truck prices in
some markets.

Italian domestic truck prices were assessed €10/t higher
at €505-515/t ex-works, including the €31/t tax on the
sale of bitumen, while those in Greece rose by €20-25/t to
€485-490/t ex-works and Turkish refiner Tupras raised its
posted domestic truck prices by Turkish Lira 730/t ($19/t) to
TL16,651/t ($516/t).

Spot demand for both cargoes and bitumen tankers was
still fairly weak, keeping freight rates under pressure.

Differentials to HSFO remained steady and this was in
part linked to hefty new Mediterranean HSFO price gains
that also dramatically narrowed the fob Rotterdam HSFO
barge premium to fob Mediterranean cargoes to around $1/t
from $11-12/t in the previous week. That made it difficult
to justify spot cargo flows from south to north to help meet
supply shortfalls into northwest European and Scandinavian
markets caused by French refinery stoppages.

Spanish fob cargo discounts to fob Mediterranean HSFO
cargoes stayed assessed at $5-10/t, with Greek, Turkish and
Italian exports all remaining in the same assessed range
around $10/t fob discounts. With fob Rotterdam and Baltic
cargo differentials to fob Rotterdam HSFO barges strength-
ening, that at least gave some encouragement to potential
arbitrage flows from the Mediterranean to northern Europe.

But Mediterranean supply continues to far outstrip
bitumen requirements within the region, with some tanker
movements made to the US and west Africa, as well as
northwest Europe.

MEDITERRANEAN MARKET COMMENTARY

The 37,000 dwt White Pearl, loaded at Tarragona, Spain,
shipped its cargo to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on the US
east coast, while the 6,175 dwt Iver Beauty, also loaded at
Tarragona, moved its cargo to Takoradi, Ghana.

Shipments bound for northwest Europe, in part respond-
ing to refinery issues at ExxonMobil's Port Jerome refinery
and TotalEnergoes' Donges refinery, included one on board
the 6,115 dwt Ping Hai Wan that was loaded at Agioi The-
odoroi, Greece, before sailing to Bayonne on France's Atlan-
tic coast. The 6,118 dwt Ning Hai Wan shipped another cargo
to Bayonne, having been loaded at Huelva, Spain.

The 6,123 dwt Xing Hai Wan, loaded at Agioi Theodoroi,
was passing Gibraltar, with its destination so far undisclosed,
while the Izmit, Turkey, loaded 21,500 dwt Baltic Narval was
making another regular shipment to northwest European
import terminals. The 36,771 dwt Asphalt Synergy returned
was expected to load another large cargo at Agioi Theodoroi
after making a delivery into Vitol's Antwerp terminal in
Belgium.

Shipping market players said the Mediterranean region
was still long on ships, with a lack of spot tanker require-
ments, partly because of the Ramadan Islamic fasting month
affecting some buying. Cross-Mediterranean freight rate as-
sessments fell $2/t for Augusta-Mohammedia and Tarragona-
Mohammedia routes to $62-65/t and $43-46/t respectively,
while other regional routes were either assessed unchanged
or with slim declines.

Algeria/Morocco/Tunisia

Market participants said there were strong levels of con-
struction activity and import demand in Algeria, with
one estimating total March cargo imports into Algeria will
amount to 70-80,000t, with Ramadan not causing any con-
struction sector slowdown so far.

Delivered cargo premiums to fob Mediterranean HSFO
into Algerian and Moroccan terminals were indicated from
the high $30s/t up to the $45/t.

While Algerian state-owned Sonatrach was set to re-
deliver the 8,021dwt Poestella back to its owners at the end
of March when its time charter period ends, market partici-
pants were awaiting confirmation that the firm had secured
another bitumen tanker under a fresh time charter arrange-
ment. Sonatrach also runs two of its own bitumen tankers,
the Ain Zeft and the Ras Tomb, both 4,999dwt vessels.

Diring the week ending 22 March, the 6,187 dwt Iver
Best, loaded at Agioi Theodoroi, shipped a cargo to Annaba,
Algeria, while the 8,021 dwt Augusta, Sicily, loaded Poestella
was waiting to unload its cargo at Skikda on 22 March.

The 8,353 dwt Castillo de Pambre delivered a Tarragona,
Spain, cargo into Mohammedia, Morocco, while the 5,897
dwt Iver Accord made a part-cargo discharge into Gabes
after an initial delivery into Sousse, both in Tunisia.

Egypt/Libya

The EU announced an $8.06bn aid package and an upgraded
relationship with Egypt on 17 March.

The proposed funding includes $5.45bn in concessional
loans and $1.96bn of investments, according to a summary
of the plan published by the EU. The deal comes on top of
the recent agreement between Egypt and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) where the terms of that $8bn loan
stipulated lower spending on infrastructure.

There was still no market optimism of any near-term
resumption of cargo imports by state-owned EGPC into its
Alexandria terminal.

There were no fresh cargo deliveries into Libyan ports,
with the last discharge made into Tripoli on 24 February.

Spain/Portugal

Spanish domestic truck prices stayed assessed at €565-575/t
ex-works, while Spanish fob bitumen cargo differentials to
fob Mediterranean HSFO cargoes were still assessed at dis-
counts of $5-10/t.

MEDITERRANEAN MARKET COMMENTARY

Numerous cargoes were exported from Tarragona,
Huelva and La Coruna throughout the week, feeding demand
in Morocco, Portugal, France, the US and west Africa. More
cargoes were likely to be exported over the 23-24 March
weekend with the 9,230 dwt Asphalt Teranga and the 7,066
dwt Herbania both waiting on 22 March to load at Tarragona.

The latest statistics from Spain's strategic reserve body
Cores showed consumption of asphalt products was 42,824t
in January, down nearly 10,000t from the same month last
year.

The 6,239 dwt Iver Brilliant shipped a cargo from the
Spanish Atlantic refinery and terminal at La Coruna to Lis-
bon, Portugal. Around 21,000t of bitumen has been exported
from La Coruna since the flows were resumed in February,
according to Vortexa.

Italy

Italian domestic truck prices were assessed €10/t higher at
€505-515/t ex-works, including the €31/t tax on bitumen
sales, while Italian fob bitumen cargo discounts to fob Medi-
terranean HSFO cargoes stayed assessed at around $10/t.

Market participants pointed to gradually improving sea-
sonal demand thanks to better weather conditions.

A fluid catalytic cracker at Eni's Sannazzaro refinery
remained offline after it was shut on 12 March due to a po-
tential catalyst problem, according to market sources in the
region, but bitumen production has remained strong there,
recently being ramped up to around 1,000t/day. One market
participant said bitumen stocks at Livorno have almost been
exhausted after the refinery was permanently shut, but the
6,180 dwt Iver Balance, understood to be under time charter
with Eni, was waiting outside Livorno on 22 March.

The latest data from Italian industry body Unem showed
bitumen consumption was provisionally 101,000t in February,
up 1,000t from February 2023. Bitumen consumption in the
first two months of the year reached 199,000t, up 7.6pc from
185,000t consumed in first two months of 2023.

The 8,476 dwt Black Shark moved a cargo from Augusta
to Naples, arriving 22 March, while other Augusta loading
vessels made shipments to Algeria. The 6,065 dwt Fuji Lava
shipped a cargo from Taranto to Galati, Romania, for 24
March arrival, while The Amigo, a 14,911 dwt vessel, was
waiting to load outside Taranto after returning from deliver-
ies in South America.

Greece

Greek fob bitumen cargo differentials to fob Mediterranean
HSFO cargoes stayed assessed at discounts of around $10/t,
while domestic truck prices increased from €466/t ex-works
at the start of the week up to €488/t ex-works by 22 March,
according to a government website.

Numerous cargoes were exported from Agioi Theodoroi,
with the 5,897 dwt Action and 6,115 dwt Ping Hai Wan
moving bitumen to terminals at Constanta, Romania, and
Bayonne, France.

Turkey

Tupras raised its posted domestic truck prices to Turkish Lira
16,651/t ($516/t) with effect from 20 March, an increase of
TL 730/t ($19/t).

Turkish fob bitumen cargo discounts to fob Mediterra-
nean HSFO cargoes stayed assessed at around $10/t.

Numerous vessels were waiting to load at Izmit for ex-
tended periods of time. The 19,928 dwt T.Aylin finished load-
ing there on 16 March, although the tanker has largely been
moving its cargoes between Tupras terminals with internal
Tupras product transfers. The 21,500 dwt Baltic Narval de-
parted from Izmit on 20 March, although its destination was
so far undisclosed.

The 45,986 dwt Bitu Atlantic was waiting to load at Izmit
on 22 March, having arrived there two days earlier.

One market participant said a resumption of bitumen
cargo exports of Iraqi bitumen trucked into terminals in
southern Turkey could resume quickly if export demand
picks up, although much will also depend on on evolving
export price levels and the state of the Turkish construction
season and domestic bitumen requirements.

SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA MARKET COMMENTARY

Summary

Price levels in most sub-Saharan African markets were
broadly stable, although cargo values into west African ter-
minals rose sharply, while there were some freight rate falls
for container shipping movements into east Africa.

South African demand began to slow as local construc-
tors started the Easter break, while there were more signs
of a slippage in Nigerian bitumen requirements after recent
sharp gains in domestic truck prices.

West Africa

A number of shipments, including spot cargo volumes,
continued to be made into Nigeria and other regional
destinations like Ghana and Sierra Leone, although bitumen
requirements have eased into the key Nigerian market in
recent weeks.

A surge in cargo prices did little to encourage west
African buying, although market participants in Nigeria said
there had been a modest retreat in local Naira truck prices
after huge gains following the country's devaluation of its
currency at the end of January.

Spanish cargo discounts to fob Mediterranean high-sul-
phur fuel oil (HSFO) cargoes were assessed unchanged at $5-
10/t on a fob basis, while Ivory Coast fob cargo premiums to
the Mediterranean HSFO values were also assessed in an un-
changed $95-100/t range. Freight rate assessments for Spain
to Nigeria 5,000t cargo movements on bitumen tankers were
assessed $5/t down at $185-195/t, after one unconfirmed
indication around $150/t. Assessed rates from Ivory Coast to
Nigeria and Ghana were $2/t and $1/t down respectively at
$57-61/t and $40-45/t.

The week's hefty HSFO gains however forced up indicat-
ed values for delivered prices into Nigerian and Ghanaian im-

after trading firms had been pointing to some cfr Nigeria
discussions around the $600/t level.

One cargo bid for imports into Nigeria was as low as fob
Mediterranean HSFO plus $40/t cfr, far below what market
participants viewed as likely deal values for standard 5,000t
spot cargoes.

The 45,986dwt Bitu Atlantic sailed back to the Mediter-
ranean after its latest deliveries into west African markets,
the last of them into Dakar, Senegal, earlier in March, with
the tanker set to load its next cargo at Turkish refiner Tupras
export terminals at Izmir and Izmit after arriving at the lat-
ter location on 20 March.

The 11,406dwt Biskra was located off Freetown, Sierra
Leone, after making a part-cargo discharge there following
an earlier delivery into into Conakry, Guinea.

Nigeria/Ghana/Angola

Local market participants said Nigerian bitumen demand had
waned over recent weeks after huge gains in local currency
prices for domestic truck supplies, but those truck values
after the Nigerian currency rebounded against the dollar.

The official and parallel market rates for Naira against
the dollar strengthened to N1,414 and N1,490 respectively on
22 March, compared with N1,550 and N1,600 respectively on

SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA MARKET COMMENTARY

8 March. Before a massive end-January Naira devaluation,
the currency's official rate had stood at N890 to the dollar.
That had helped drive up domestic ex-works truck prices to
as high as N1.55-1.6mn/t around mid-March. Those values
slipped in the week ending 22 March to N1.42-1.43mn/t ex-
works, according to one market participant.

The 7,444dwt Lilstella, which had been loaded at Tar-
ragona, Spain, was waiting to discharge its cargo fully into
a Nigerian import terminal at Port Harcourt after arriving
there on 19-20 March, with some local players expecting
further such journeys on the tanker into Nigeria in the com-
ing few weeks.

The 6,033dwt Jane Asphalt returned to the SMB export
terminal at Abidjan on 17 March after a delivery into Gradi-
ent Bitumen's 27,000t capacity terminal in Warri - the fourth
such delivery in a row, with one those movements made on
board SMB's own time-chartered 4,900dwt San Biagio. The
latter vessel was understood to have delivered a separate
cargo into another Warri terminal, leaving that facility on
21 March and heading back to Abidjan - for 24 March arrival

- to load a fresh cargo.

A rare European spot cargo shipment was being made by
an international trading firm from Tarragona, Spain, to the
Takoradi import terminal in Ghana, with arrival likely around
end-March. It was being made on the 6,175dwt Iver Beauty.

The 15,000 dwt Bitu River, loaded in ship-to-ship (STS)
operations off Lome, Togo, left Luanda, Angola, on 21 March
after discharging a part-cargo there following a similar dis-
charge into Douala, Cameroon. The vessel was due to arrive
back off Lome around 27 March.

East Africa

Trading activity slowed considerably as Iranian market par-
ticipants began their Nowruz celebrations and holiday recess
that is set to last through into the first week of April.

Export prices from the Mideast Gulf port of Bandar Abbas
showed little change, with bulk cargoes assessed $0.50/t
down at $280-287/t on a fob basis, while drummed exports
were assessed $2/t up at $335-350/t. Bahraini bulk cargo
export prices set by state-owned Bapco were raised by $20/t
to $380/t fob Sitra after they had been held unchanged for
several weeks.

Freight rate assessments for container shipping move-
ments from Bandar/Jebel Ali (UAE) to east African ports
were steady to softer. Assessed rates for drummed flows to
Mombasa, Kenya, were held steady at $85-100/t, while rates
to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania were assessed $2-3/t down at
$95-105/t. Rates to the Horn of Africa port of Djibouti, which
mainly serves the Ethiopian market, were assessed $15/t
down at $145-155/t as market participants reported rates for
indirect Iranian drummed shipments to Djibouti from Jebel
Ali had been reduced by international container shipping
lines in March to $3,000/container ($150/t) from $3,500/con-
tainer in both January and February after a sharp elevation
in rates in the wake of Houthi attacked on Red Sea shipping.

Kenya

A tanker carrying around 3,800t of bulk bitumen, loaded in
the Mideast Gulf, remained en route to the Skytrade Global
import terminal in Mombasa, with scheduled arrival there on
2 April.

Suppliers continued to see regular bulk as well as
drummed business into end-users in Kenya, as well as South
Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with
some bitutainer and bulk truck movements made into the
latter market alongside drummed flows. Trade financing is-
sues remained in the way of concluding deals into Ethiopia.

In Uganda, late payments to road contractors by govern-
ment agencies led those bitumen buyers to seek extended
payment periods for import volumes, mainly moved by truck
from Mombasa into the land-locked country, terms that
didn't suit some suppliers.

Southern Africa

A planned May-June maintenance shutdown at the Natref
refinery in Sasolburg, South Africa (see news) was likely to
invite more import cargoes before winter starts to cause an
activity and demand slowdown, mainly in South Africa.

For the time being, South African constructors began

Argus Bitumen

Issue 24-12  Friday 22 March 2024

SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA MARKET COMMENTARY

to slow work for the Easter holiday, while there continued
to be regular truck movements from South African supply
points into markets like Zambia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and
Namibia.

South Africa

Domestic truck prices were assessed unchanged at Rand
12,600-13,000/t ex-works, but there remained intense com-
petition from several cargo receivers into the country look-
ing to sell off sizeable incoming flows to maintain or enhance
their market share.

One local truck supplier was understood to have cut its
selling price by R100/t to R12,800/t ex-works, while another
was offering its volumes at R12,600/t ex-works, with even
lower prices expected for some forthcoming import vol-
umes.

An upcoming maintenance shutdown at the 108,500 b/d
Sasol majority owned Natref refinery in Sasolburg - which
market participants said was set to begin on 15 May and
last until the end of June (see news) 、 was thought likely to
invite yet more import cargoes into Durban and Cape Town,
although bitumen use in road projects slows down for the
southern hemisphere winter from June through to August.

The immediate activity and demand picture was slow as
construction sector firms began their Easter holiday recess
affecting much of their road-building operations from around
18 March through to the week commencing 1 April (Easter
Monday), with that week itself exported to see only a slow
return towards normal operations.

Sizeable cargo volumes were meanwhile heading into the
country, with the 5,985dwt R S G arriving at Durban on 21
March with a cargo loaded at Sitra, Bahrain. The 21,500dwt
Atlantic Narval was still located at Durban after arriving
there on 17 March for a part-cargo discharge into the FFS
Refiners/Rubis Asphalt ship-to-tank bitumen terminal there,
having made am initial discharge into a similar set-up at
Cape Town.

The 5,261 dwt Bitumen Kosei, which was loaded at Port
Qasim, Pakistan, was scheduled to arrive at Durban on 30
March.

ASIA-PACIFIC AND MIDDLE EAST MARKET COMMENTARY

Singapore

Singapore bitumen prices edged lower, as the southeast
Asian market continues to see a lack of demand outlets,
with only limited buyers seeking out April-loading cargoes.
Several oil majors were still holding on to unsold April-load-
ing volumes and emerged on the Argus Open Markets (AOM)
platform to seek out buyers.

Price spreads with high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) 380cst
values have grown increasingly wide, with Singapore ABX 1
currently trading at around discounts of over $70/t to that
of HSFO 380cst. Such spreads have not been seen since late
August 2023. While some refineries in south China have
either cut production or temporarily shut due to increas-
ingly squeezed margins amid firm upstream crude feedstock
costs, oil majors in Singapore have yet to follow suit.

Cargoes were discussed over a wide range during the
week. A deal for a 3,500t cargo was done to Indonesia at
around $375-380/t fob Singapore on a netback basis, with
the cargo loading in the middle of April. Buying indications
fell to around $380-385/t fob following the conclusion of
the deal, with importers unwilling to commit unless steep
discounts were provided. A second deal for a 3,000-3,500t
cargo loading in first-half April was also done towards the
end of the week, at around $379-385/t fob Singapore on
a netback basis. A third deal was done to Indonesia, for a
3,000-4,000t cargo loading in April at around $403-408/t fob
Singapore on a netback basis.

Two deals were initiated on the AOM platform during the
week. Puma Energy placed a bid for a 3,500t cargo loading
over 2-5 April at $400/t fob Singapore on AOM, which was
raised to $410/t fob Singapore, before a deal was initiated by
PetroChina. Puma Energy also bid for a 3,000t cargo loading
over 9-13 April at $400/t fob Singapore. The bid was raised

to $415/t fob Singapore and a deal was once again initiated
by PetroChina.

At least two suppliers were no longer looking to offer
April-loading cargoes to south China due to unattractive
pricing there, given the lower-cost of local products. Some
offers to south China were at $430-460/t cfr and higher, but
these attracted muted buying interest. Buying indications
were as low as $360/t fob Singapore, though these remain
completely unworkable for Singapore exporters.

Competitive domestic prices in Malaysia also kept inter-
est for truck cargoes at bay. Prices for Singapore tank trucks
sold into Malaysia fell again to $403-416/t ex-refinery from
$415-424/t ex-refinery last week, in line with higher supplies
relative to demand.

Malaysia

Singapore refiners continued to redirect supplies towards
trucked bitumen exports to Malaysia. They also consecutive-
ly lowered offer prices again to remain competitive against
each other. The export quotas of trucked bitumen were
stable at around 6-7 truckloads per buyer daily.

Lifting of bitumen material was mixed, with some Sin-
gapore refiners experiencing slower lifting compared with
domestic sellers. This is likely because of location advantag-
es that domestic sellers have, on top of competitive pricing
against Singapore offers.

Ex-Malacca listed prices fell further to 1,860-2,050
ringgit/t ($392.59-432.57/t) from 2,070-2,120 ringgit/t last
week. Ex-Tanjung Langsat trucks were offered at between
$422-425/t, depending on the timing of delivery. Trucks
delivered into Johor fell to 2,040 ringgit/t, from 2,155
ringgit/t. Ex-Port Klang prices also fell to 2,040-2,080
ringgit/t, from 2,080-2,140 ringgit/t last week.

Indonesia

Consumption in the country during this year's Ramadan
period has been much slower than expected, especially
compared with the previous year, because of a lack of ongo-
ing road-paving projects.

Participants attribute this to a delay in the release of
new road-paving tenders due to elections in February and a
lack of funding.

Accumulated inventories from cargoes imported in late
2023 and early this year were also sufficient for contractors
to cater to any remaining multi-year road-paving projects
ahead of Ramadan. This contrasts with late 2022, when a
vessel shortage situation caused a supply shortage in Indone-
sia, subsequently prolonging roadworks.

At least two 3,000-4,000t, Singapore-origin cargo loading
over first-half April was procured at around $425-440/t cfr,
which market participants estimated to net back to around
$375-385/t fob Singapore. A 3,000-4,000t April laycan cargo
was sold at around $450/t cfr toward the end of the week,
with freight estimated to be around $40-45/t.

Most buying indications fell to $380-390/t fob Singapore,
on the back of ample supplies and lacklustre demand. An
offer was made at around $405-415/t fob Singapore to be
loaded during April, which was counter bid at around $390-
410/t fob Singapore.

Thailand

Domestic consumption remained slow, pushing domestic re-
finers to continue offering unsold stocks in the export mar-
ket. Domestic demand will likely only return in May, once
Songkran is over in April. This will reduce exports - as well
as supply pressures - to the wider southeast Asian region.

A 3,000t second-half April, Thai-origin cargo was sold

Argus Bitumen

Issue 24-12  Friday 22 March 2024

ASIA-PACIFIC AND MIDDLE EAST MARKET COMMENTARY

to a southeast Asian destination at around $365-370/t fob
Thailand.

Offers were otherwise around $370-380/t fob Thailand,
while some buying indications were located around $360/t
fob Thailand.

Vietnam

Consumption in Vietnam continued to be lacklustre on the
back of unseasonal inclement weather, especially in the key
northern region. This, along with weakness in Vietnamese
dong against the US dollar, pressured domestic selling prices
and kept inventories at higher levels.

Enquiries for seaborne April laycan cargoes were minimal
because of ullage issues in the region, which also weighed
on buying indications. A 3,000t southeast Asia origin,
second-half April laycan cargo was sold at $430-435/t cfr
Haiphong, with freight estimated to be around $60-65/t.

Buying indications for Singapore and Thailand origin car-
goes were few and at around $380-385/t fob Singapore and
around $360/t fob Thailand.

Meanwhile, market participants said that domestic selling
prices were at 11,800 dongs/kg, mostly unchanged from last
week. But domestic prices on a US dollar basis fell to around
$468-470/t ex-tank from $483-488/t ex-tank last week,
thanks to weakness in the Vietnamese dong. At least one
importer noted that cargoes currently being discharged or
scheduled to be discharged this month were dealt at around
$465/t cfr Haiphong or $445/t cfr south Vietnam, and profit
margins are likely to be squeezed.

cluded a tender to sell fourteen 5,000t cargoes loading over
April on 21 March. Most of the volumes are understood to
have been settled at discounts of around $60-70/t to HSFO
380 values. This is equivalent to around $400-410/t fob
South Korea. Some smaller volumes were also settled at
discounts of around $50/t to that of HSFO 380.

Despite gains on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, buying
indications from some east China importers were initially
maintained at around $400/t fob South Korea, as domestic
prices still remain lower in comparison to that of imports.

China

The domestic market in China drew support from higher
costs resulting from firmer crude values. Domestic prices in
the eastern and southern regions rose to 3,470-3,770 yuan/t
($479.99-521.49/t) and Yn3,400-3,440/t, respectively.

Clearer and warmer weather in most of the country's
south and east encouraged some lifting, although overall
trading activity was thin. Most buyers were on the sidelines
this week, given volatile upstream crude values and an un-
certain market outlook.

Reduced production across the country in April will
likely keep prices afloat in the short term despite sluggish
demand. Participants also say that any further reduction in
domestic prices is highly unlikely, given some refineries were
already incurring steep losses due to firm feedstock costs.
Some refineries have also remained shut because of poor
profit margins and demand, keeping spot supply limited.

An approaching warmer spring season might uplift
domestic consumption slightly in the short-term before the
rainy season starts in the eastern regions during April-May.
Funding constraints could continue to limit roading projects,
though some market participants say demand could pick up
in May or June, when the government issues fresh road-pav-
ing tenders for contractors.

Cargoes for import into east China were discussed at
around $430-440/t cfr basis early in the week. But buying
indications inched higher to around $440-445/t cfr, following
the conclusion of the most recent South Korean export ten-
der. This was against offers for April-loadings at $450-460/t
cfr levels.

Import interest from south China remained lacklustre, as
the region continues to grapple with slow consumption and
higher inventory levels. Offers were around $440-450/t cfr
south China, but this attracted little buying interest.

Some April-loading exports from south China were sold at
prices well above $400/t fob, higher than current Singapore
export prices.

Taiwan

Taiwan export prices were pressured lower, tracking losses
in the wider Asia-Pacific region. Some offers and selling in-
dications were at around $405/t fob Taiwan, but these were
met with no buying interest from southeast Asian importers.

markets were at around $390/t fob, as the lack of available
ullage curbed demand for imports.

Australia & New Zealand

Domestic consumption is gradually waning ahead of Easter
holidays. Participants said demand could fall significantly
thereafter and the slow market momentum may last through
April before picking up again in May-June, albeit not signifi-
cantly, when contractors start wrapping up roadwork proj-
ects ahead of the end of the current financial year in June.

India

Consumption in some parts of country picked up as many
contractors were trying to wrap up projects ahead of the
end of the current financial year ending this month. But
importers and dealers noted that demand was still below
normal because of a funding crunch, which induced a slow-
down in state-government linked works.

Demand for imported cargoes at Mangalore and Karwar
port were robust, and this increased enquiries for seaborne
cargoes for discharge into these ports. But demand was rela-
tively lacklustre at Mumbai and some ports of Gujarat.

At least 9,000-10,000t of forward loading bulk bitumen
was purchased at $280-290/t on fob basis. This was lower
than the 33,000-38,000t transacted last week as most of the
suppliers in the Middle East took to the sidelines to cel-
ebrate a regional new year, limiting market activity.

Although bids and indications were below $280/t on
fob basis, limited prompt laycan supply kept the discus-
sion and transaction range at $280-290/t fob, little changed
from last week's $283-290/t fob. Importers also mentioned
that despite improvement in domestic sales, profit margins
continued to be squeezed also because of the additional
demurrage incurred on the back of the port congestions
in the Middle East. Meanwhile, market participants expect
consumption to falter next week because of holidays linked
to the Hindu Holi festival.

State-controlled refiners in Mumbai reduced listed VG10
and VG30 bulk and drummed bitumen prices by 570 rupees/t
($6.85/t) for the current fortnight, from the previous two-
week period. Listed VG40 cargo prices were reduced by
Rs660/t.

ASIA-PACIFIC AND MIDDLE EAST MARKET COMMENTARY

Bahrain

Listed seaborne bitumen prices in Bahrain increased by
$20/t from the previous week to $380/t fob Sitra, supported
by firm crude and fuel oil values, even though demand for
Bahraini origin cargoes continued to be weak. News of any
export activities were slow to emerge.

Iran

The Iranian export market was mostly silent for the Nowruz
holidays. But exporters raised concerns over uncertainties in
exchange rate volatility and supply-demand fundamentals.

Most producers and suppliers were on the sidelines and
did not offer any fresh cargoes, as they were waiting for the
fortnightly revision of vacuum bottom (VB) feedstock listed
prices, which are expected to increase by more than 7pc
from the previous fortnight.

Bids for prompt and forward laycan bulk were located at
$280-285/t fob Iran, with some deals concluded into south
Asia at $280-290/t fob Iran. Most suppliers were busy deliv-
ering previously sold cargoes.

Exporters expect an increase in seaborne prices in the
coming week on the back of strong upstream crude and
HSFO values. Given the slowdown in delivery of feedstock
from the national refineries to private producers, the ongo-
ing supply tightness is likely to prolong, providing further
expected support to seaborne offers.

Drums were offered at $340-360/t fob Iran, but no fresh
deals emerged at these prices with prices falling in the
south Asia consuming market. Demand was strong for jumbo
bags, but some suppliers were fully booked up to May deliv-
eries. Bids were at $335-345/t fob this week.

No cargoes were offered on the Iran Mercantile Exchange
(IME).

On the IME, export sales rose to 7.59mn t in the last fi-
nancial year ended earlier this month, from 5.04mn t during
the previous financial year. One of the largest bitumen ex-
porters in Iran over the past Iranian financial year was state-
owned Jey Oil, with the refiner selling a total of 1.02mn t of
bitumen, according to official data.

State-owned Pasargad Oil sold 918,550t, while private
producer Black Gold and White Gold sold a total of 879,000t.
Private supplier, Spadana Bitumen Pasargadis, sold a total of
675,000t, while Parsian Energy sold a total of 600,119t.

The Pars Behin Qeshm Oil Refining Company, the sole
refinery in the Qeshm island, exported 590,000t of bitumen
on fob Qeshm basis in the last financial year.

Trading activities on the IME was muted because of Nowruz.
During the last financial year, VB feedstock sales on the IME
increased to around 7.33mn t, up from 4.67mm t in the prior

domestic road paving projects in the previous financial year.

French refinery fire squeezes regional supply

Disruptions at two French refineries have squeezed bitumen
supply in northwest Europe just as the region's spring road
paving season gets underway.

ExxonMobil halted bitumen truck loadings from its
236,000 b/d Port Jerome refinery in northern France last
week after a fire hit a crude distillation unit on 11 March,
compounding problems at TotalEnergies' 219,300 b/d Donges
refinery.

In a letter sent to Port Jerome customers, ExxonMobil
said it could not "confirm with certainty the date on which
bitumen deliveries will become fully operational again and
cannot advance any date on which sales of our products
could resume normally".

The company is also understood to have declared force
majeure on two bitumen cargoes that were due to be loaded
from Port Jerome in the next few weeks, although it did
manage to load one cargo onto the 6,165 dwt An Hai Wan,
according to a market participant. That cargo was due to
arrive at Antwerp 20 March.

The disruption at Port Jerome coincides with an ongo-
ing shutdown at the Donges refinery linked to inspections
by local authorities. Although TotalEnergies said it does not
expect a full restart until the start of April, bitumen produc-
tion appears to have resumed already, with tracking data
from Kpler and Vortexa showing the 6,189dwt Iver Blessing
loading a bitumen cargo from Donges on 20 March.

Bitumen availability at TotalEnergies' 246,000 b/d Gon-
freville refinery in northern France's Normandy region is also
constrained. Some buyers say the refinery has yet to resume
spot sales following the end of maintenance last week.

The squeeze on French bitumen has led to a sharp
increase in demand for alternative supply from elsewhere in
northwest Europe, which has pushed up Rotterdam and Bal-
tic fob cargo premiums to high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) barges
in recent weeks.

Shell's 404,000 b/d Pernis plant, Europe's biggest re-
finery, is undergoing a rolling turnaround until mid-April.
Although most regional market players say the work has
had a minimal impact on Pernis' bitumen supplies, Shell's
significant commitment to term deals with Nordic buyers
has restricted surpluses available for the spot market. Some
inland buyers in northwest Europe have reported limited
availability of truck supplies from Pernis.

The French refinery outages have also increased demand
for Mediterranean bitumen imports to northwest Europe.
A large bitumen cargo that was loaded at Greece's Agioi
Theodoroi export terminal arrived at trading firm Vitol's

Antwerp terminal last week on board the company's 36,771
dwt Asphalt Synergy. It was a timely delivery and the first of
its kind this year.

Bitumen cargoes are regularly moved from the Mediter-
ranean to northern Europe as part of term supply deals. But
even though the Mediterranean currently holds sizeable bitu-
men surpluses, the price gap between northwest European
and Mediterranean bitumen prices is still too narrow to trig-
ger significant south to north spot cargo flows.

This is partly because tight fuel oil supply and strong
Mediterranean bunker demand have triggered a fresh spike
in fob Mediterranean HSFO cargo prices, which reached a
discount of just $0.75/t to fob Rotterdam HSFO barge values
on 19 March, compared with a $17.25/t discount on 11 March
and a $27/t discount on 19 January. Mediterranean and
northwest European bitumen cargoes are mainly traded as
differentials to HSFO prices in the respective regions.

UK inflation erodes real-term highway spending

Real-term cuts in local authority road maintenance budgets
in England and Wales have caused a further deterioration in
their road surfaces, UK asphalt industry body AIA said. UK
bitumen consumption fell to a seven year low in 2023.

In its latest Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance
(Alarm) survey of local government highways departments,

the AIA said local authorities in England and Wales had in
their financial year ending 31 March "experienced a real-
term [spending] cut due to the impact of rising costs due
to inflation". That was "despite average [road] maintenance
budgets increasing by 2.3pc to £26.4mm per authority", the
AIA said, finding that 45pc of local authorities reported a cut
or freeze in their highway maintenance budgets even before
inflation was taken into account.

The steady deterioration of the road network contrib-
uted to a 43pc annual increase in the number of potholes
reported by local authorities to have been filled in England
and Wales during 2023-24, to an eight-year high of 2mn.

UK bitumen consumption fell in 2023 to 1.54mn t, the
lowest since 2016, according to provisional government data
released earlier this month.

In its survey conclusions, the AIA also said today the
"one-time catch-up cost" of bringing roads in England and
Wales up to the standard enabling the network to be man-
aged cost-effectively had jumped by 16pc to a new record
high of £16.3bn, and that the work needed to address the
shortfall would take a decade to complete. It said the ad-
ditional funds English and Welsh local authorities would have
needed to maintain their networks in accordance with their
own targets is £1.22bn, meaning the average shortfall in
their 2023-24 carriageway budget was £7.2mm per authority.

Argus launches daily price assessments for fob
Singapore and fob South Korea from 1 November 2021,
adding to the existing weekly benchmark prices.

The new Argus assessments will highlight daily price
movements in the Asian bitumen market, enabling

In its Alarm survey this time last year, the AIA had re-
ported local authority road maintenance catch-up costs had
in the 2022-23 year increased by nearly 11pc to £14.02bn, at
that time the highest on record, with the association pre-
dicting further cost increases.

SA Natref refinery to shut for May-June work

The 108,500 b/d Natref refinery at Sasolburg, South Africa,
will be fully shut for planned maintenance from mid-May
until the end of June.

While the halt will hit production and supply of oil prod-
ucts as a whole, bitumen market participants have also been
notified that there will be no supply of the product during
the whole of May and June.

The refinery, South Africa's only remaining bitumen-pro-
ducing refinery with typical output of the product estimated
at 150,000-200,000 t/yr, is majority owned by South African
integrated energy firm Sasol with a 63.64pc stake. TotalEn-
ergies agreed late last year to sell its 36.36pc minority stake
in the refinery to UK-based Prax for an undisclosed sum.

South Africa and the wider southern Africa region are
now largely reliant on bitumen imports.

A total of almost 180,000t of bitumen was delivered
into Durban and Cape Town by specialised tankers last year,
according to Vortexa, compared with around 100,000t in
2022 and negligible amounts in 2021 - before several South
African refineries were shut or stopped producing bitumen.
Several international trading and supply firms compete to
supply cargoes from the Mideast Gulf, Pakistan, Europe and
west Africa to local importers.

Smaller quantities of bitumen are also imported into
South Africa using heated bitumen containers - bitutainers
- as well as drums and bags.

TotalEnergies sees Donges restart in early April

TotalEnergies has said its 219,000 b/d Donges oil refinery on
the French Atlantic coast will not resume operations until
the start of April.

The refinery has been shut since February, the second
time in three months it had to halt operations. There have
been a number of issues connected with inspections by local
authorities, which started last year.

The refinery's catalytic cracker (FCC) has been offline
since December. It was scheduled to resume operations at
the end of March, but this now appears to have been pushed
back. A worker said the early April restart could be optimis-
tic. "This is what has been planned. But right now it is not
possible to say we will make that."

Argus Bitumen

Issue 24-12  Friday 22 March 2024

NEWS

The closure of Donges has prompted a number of short
haul oil products cargoes to be imported at the refinery
terminal in March. Two crude cargoes are signalling arrival
at the port around the turn of the month, suggestive of a
restart. A shipment of about 130,000t of Angolan Clov and
90,000t of US WTI are slated to arrive on 29 March and 3
April, respectively.

Neste says Porvoo strike will not affect output

Finland's Neste said production will not be affected by a
strike underway at its 205,000 b/d Porvoo oil refinery, but
port and terminal operations will be disrupted.

The Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK)
announced a two-week strike, between 11-25 March, in re-
sponse to government plans to changes in labour laws, right
to strike and social welfare.

"Neste and the industrial union agreed that essential
work will continue during the announced strikes," the
company said. "This essential work enables safe operations
at Neste's Porvoo refinery and the continuation of critical
product deliveries, safeguarding the national security of
supply. Despite these agreed actions the strike will cause
disruptions to the distribution of fuels."

An importer to Finnish bitumen terminals said the
schedule for bitumen cargo movements in and out of the
country has already been affected, just as this year's Nordic
road paving and bitumen-consuming season starts to get into
gear.

The importer said it had been able to re-arrange vessels
to arrive after the end of the strike period, but said there
are concerns about potential further action beyond those
already planned by unions.

Neste plans a nine-week refinery-wide maintenance
between April-June at Porvoo. The plant has a 250,000 t/
yr Group III base oil unit that accounts for around 28pc of
Europe's Group III nameplate capacity.

Neste will convert Porvoo into a 3mn t/yr renewables
facility, and withdraw from crude refining. It will produce
several renewable and circular products instead including,
biodiesel, sustainable aviation fluid, polymers and chemicals
as feedstocks.

Colombian Ecopetrol's sales rise in 2023

Colombian state-controlled oil company Ecopetrol's asphalt/
bitumen sales increased in 2023, boosted by rising exports
and domestic demand for several advanced road projects.

Ecopetrol's sold 698,225 metric tonnes (t) of asphalt to
the domestic and international markets last year, a 4pc rise
from 2022.

The increase helped the firm reduce scope 3 emissions,
replace production of fuel oil and strengthen its position in
the international market, it said.

Ecopetrol sold a little more than 50pc of its asphalt
production in the international market last year, former
product and petrochemicals manager Felipe Trujillo had said
previously.

But the firm did not specify how much of the total sales
were exported, saying that such information is confidential.
Ecopetrol exported almost 270,560t of asphalt in January-
October, up from approximately 254,900t shipped in all of
2022, according to Trujillo.

Ecopetrol exported around 342,170t of asphalt in 2023,
according to data by trade analytics firm Kpler. That is a
near 40pc hike from 2022.

The main export destinations were the US, Puerto Rico,
Chile, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Mexico and Honduras,
Ecopetrol said. Latin American asphalt buyers shifted to buy-
ing more regionally in 2023, a source said.

Ecopetrol began exporting asphalt to Chile for the first
time in July, when it shipped 12,000t to the country.

In the domestic market, Colombia moved forward with
several road projects, according to infrastructure agency
ANI. It inaugurated a stretch of a double-lane corridor that
connects Bogota with towns in the capital's outskirts in Au-
gust. The project is part of larger plan that comprises 66km
(41 miles) in double-lane corridors demanding Ps1.87 trillion
Colombian pesos ($477mn) in investments.

Spanish construction firm Sacyr started working on a
stretch of the Pamplona-Cucuta road in May. Colombia also
inaugurated a 49km stretch of the Autopista al Rio Magda-
lena 2 road, which comprises 153km, in July.

Colombia's $20bn 4G infrastructure plan comprises 29
publicly and privately funded highway projects.

Last year the country also paved a section of a Bogota El
Dorado Airport taxiway with modified asphalt that contains
415kg of recycled plastic.
